DISCLAIMER: NONE OF THIS IS FORMAL ADVICE. THIS PROJECT SHARES RESEARCH FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES, APPLY AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Biobase seeks to be a community-sourced, comprehensive encyclopedia of human health. There are 3 main goals:

- To fosture independent research
- To explain health in layman's terms
- To engage productive dialogue between different therapy standpoints

Over time, I would like to see it evolve into a bigger project for funding and engaging research, and formally educating practitioners.
